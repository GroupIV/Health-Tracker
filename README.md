Health-Tracker
==============

This year’s class project is to develop a software system called “personal health 
tracker” application that helps individuals to keep track of physical activities that affect 
their health and keep a record of health indicators daily basis. Some of the physical 
activities are cardio workout, strength workout, work hours, how much time an individual 
slept. Some health indicators are blood pressure, blood sugar and pulse rate (thinks can 
be measured at home). 

System should be able to store above physical activities and health indicators daily basis 
see and print a summary of weekly or monthly activities/health indicators. Idea is that 
when an individual goes to the doctor’s office for well-check visit he or she can get a 
printout of a summary of activities/health indicators.
